# Overview

This program is a Server-Client connection written in C++. I learned how Server-Client models in python in the past,
but I wanted to also learn in C++.

The server needs to be started first, and then it will be listening to any connections. When the client side is started
it will prompt the user to a message. The client then will send the message to the server and the server will display
on the terminal the message received. The server replies the client message notifying that the message was received.
The server will keep running until the client sent a message saying "close".
